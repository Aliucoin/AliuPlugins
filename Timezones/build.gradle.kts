        # 1.1.4
        - Added option for user time in message timestamp (looks bad but works)
        
        # 1.1.0
        - Added TimezoneDB support (by mantikafasi)
        
        # 1.0.7
        - Made settings page look slightly nicer
        
        # Announcement
        I don't plan on adding new features since the base functionality is already here.
        Feel free to PR if you want.
